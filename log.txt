Insight runs in NodeJS, uses AngularJS for the\nfront-end and LevelDB for storage.\n\nCheck some screenshots and more details at [insight's project homepage](http://insight.is/).\n\n*Insight* project is now splitted in two repositories. One for the [API](https://github.com/bitpay/insight-api) and for the front-end. This repository is for the front-end, which will install the API as a NPM dependency.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n* **Node.js v0.10.x** - Download and Install [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/download/).\n\n* **NPM** - Node.js package manager, should be automatically installed when you get node.js.\n\n## Quick Install\n  Check the Prerequisites section above before installing.\n\n  To install Insight, clone the main repository:\n\n    $ git clone https://github.com/bitpay/insight.git && cd insight\n\n  Install dependencies:\n\n    $ npm install\n    \n  Run the main application:\n\n    $ npm start\n    \n  Then open a browser and go to:\n\n    http://localhost:3001\n\n  If *insight* reports problems connecting to **bitcoind** please check the CONFIGURATION section of \n  [insight-api README](https://github.com/bitpay/insight-api/blob/master/README.md). To set the \n  environment variables run something like:\n  \n     $ INSIGHT_NETWORK=livenet BITCOIND_USER=user BITCOIND_PASS=pass INSIGHT_PUBLIC_PATH=public  npm start\n\n\n  Please note that the app will need to sync its internal database\n  with the blockchain state, which may take some time. You can check\n  sync progress from within the web interface. More details about that process\n  on [insight-api README](https://github.com/bitpay/insight-api/blob/master/README.md). \n  \n  \n## Nginx Setup\n\nTo use Nginx as a reverse proxy for Insight, use the following base [configuration](https://gist.github.com/matiu/bdd5e55ff0ad90b54261)\n\n\n## Development\n\nTo run insight locally for development mode:\n\nInstall bower dependencies:\n\n```\n$ bower install\n```\n\nTo compile and minify the web application's assets:\n\n```\n$ grunt compile\n```\n\nThere is a convinent Gruntfile.js for automation during editing the code\n\n```\n$ grunt\n```\n\n\nIn case you are developing *insight* and *insight-api* toghether, you can do the following:\n\n* Install insight and insight-api on the same path ($IROOT)\n\n```\n  $ cd $IROOT/insight\n  $ grunt\n```\n\nin other terminal:\n\n```\n  $ cd $IROOT/insight-api \n  $ ln -s ../insight/public\n  $ INSIGHT_PUBLIC_PATH=public node insight.js \n```\n\n\n``` \nINSIGHT_PUBLIC_PATH=insight/public  grunt\n```\n\nat insight-api's home path (edit the path according your setup).\n\n**also** in the insight-api path. (So you will have to grunt process running, one for insight and one for insight-api).\n\n\n## Multilanguage support\n\ninsight use [angular-gettext](http://angular-gettext.rocketeer.be) for\nmultilanguage support. \n\nTo enable a text to be translated, add the ***translate*** directive to html tags. See more details [here](http://angular-gettext.rocketeer.be/dev-guide/annotate/). Then, run:\n\n```\ngrunt compile\n```\n\nThis action will create a template.pot file in ***po/*** folder. You can open\nit with some PO editor ([Poedit](http://poedit.net)). Read this [guide](http://angular-gettext.rocketeer.be/dev-guide/translate/) to learn how to edit/update/import PO files from a generated POT file. PO file will be generated inside po/ folder.\n\nIf you make new changes, simply run **grunt compile** again to generate a new .pot template and the angular javascript ***js/translations.js***. Then (if use Poedit), open .po file and choose ***update from POT File*** from **Catalog** menu.\n\nFinally changes your default language from ***public/src/js/config*** \n\n```\ngettextCatalog.currentLanguage = 'es';\n```\n\nThis line will take a look at any *.po files inside ***po/*** folder, e.g.\n**po/es.po**, **po/nl.po**. After any change do not forget to run ***grunt\ncompile***.\n\n\n## Note\n\nFor more details about the *insight API* configs and end-point, just go to [insight API github repository](https://github.com/bitpay/insight-api) or read the [documentation](https://github.com/bitpay/insight-api/blob/master/README.md)\n\n## Contribute\n\nContributions and suggestions are welcomed at [insight github repository](https://github.com/bitpay/insight).\n\n\n## License\n(The MIT License)\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n","default_branch":"master","commits":1147,"devPackages":["bower","grunt","grunt-cli","grunt-contrib-jshint","grunt-contrib-concat","grunt-contrib-uglify","grunt-contrib-watch","grunt-macreload","grunt-css","grunt-markdown","grunt-angular-gettext"],"packages":["csc-insight-api-v0.2"],"devPackagesDescr":{"bower":"The browser package manager","grunt":"The JavaScript Task Runner","grunt-cli":"The grunt command line interface","grunt-contrib-jshint":"Validate files with JSHint","grunt-contrib-concat":"Concatenate files.","grunt-contrib-uglify":"Minify JavaScript files with UglifyJS","grunt-contrib-watch":"Run predefined tasks whenever watched file patterns are added, changed or deleted","grunt-macreload":"A small grunt-task that reloads your browser (OSX only) [DEPRECATED]","grunt-css":"Grunt plugin for linting and minifying CSS","grunt-markdown":"Compile markdown to html.

Insight API runs in NodeJS and uses LevelDB for storage. \n\nThis is a backend-only service. If you're looking for the web frontend application,\ntake a look at https://github.com/bitpay/insight.\n\n*Insight API* allows to develop bitcoin-related applications (such as wallets) that \nrequire certain information from the blockchain that bitcoind does not provide.\n\nA blockchain explorer front-end has been developed on top of *Insight API*. It can\nbe downloaded at [Github Insight Repository](https://github.com/bitpay/insight).\n\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n* **bitcoind** - Download and Install [Bitcoin](http://bitcoin.org/en/download)\n\n*insight API* needs a *trusted* bitcoind node to run. *insight API* will connect to the node\nthrough the RPC API, bitcoin peer-to-peer protocol, and will even read its raw block .dat files for syncing.\n\nConfigure bitcoind to listen to RPC calls and set `txindex` to true.\nThe easiest way to do this is by copying `./etc/bitcoind/bitcoin.conf` to your\nbitcoin data directory (usually `~/.bitcoin` on Linux, `%appdata%\\Bitcoin\\` on Windows,\nor `~/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin` on Mac OS X).\n\nbitcoind must be running and must have finished downloading the blockchain **before** running *insight API*.\n\n\n* **Node.js v0.10.x** - Download and Install [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/download/).\n\n* **NPM** - Node.js package manager, should be automatically installed when you get node.js.\n\n## Quick Install\n  Check the Prerequisites section above before installing.\n\n  To install Insight API, clone the main repository:\n\n    $ git clone https://github.com/bitpay/insight-api && cd insight-api\n\n  Install dependencies:\n\n    $ npm install\n\n  Run the main application:\n\n    $ node insight.js\n\n  Then open a browser and go to:\n\n    http://localhost:3001\n\n  Please note that the app will need to sync its internal database\n  with the blockchain state, which may take some time. You can check\n  sync progress at http://localhost:3001/api/sync.\n\n\n## Configuration\n\nAll configuration is specified in the [config](config/) folder, particularly the [config.js](config/config.js) file. There you can specify your application name and database name. Certain configuration values are pulled from environment variables if they are defined:\n\n```\nBITCOIND_HOST         # RPC bitcoind host\nBITCOIND_PORT         # RPC bitcoind Port\nBITCOIND_P2P_HOST     # P2P bitcoind Host (will default to BITCOIND_HOST, if specified)\nBITCOIND_P2P_PORT     # P2P bitcoind Port\nBITCOIND_USER         # RPC username\nBITCOIND_PASS         # RPC password\nBITCOIND_DATADIR      # bitcoind datadir. 'testnet3' will be appended automatically if testnet is used. NEED to finish with '/'. e.g: `/vol/data/`\nINSIGHT_NETWORK [= 'livenet' | 'testnet']\nINSIGHT_PORT          # insight api port\nINSIGHT_DB            # Path where to store insight's internal DB. (defaults to $HOME/.insight)\nINSIGHT_SAFE_CONFIRMATIONS=6  # Nr. of confirmation needed to start caching transaction information   \nINSIGHT_IGNORE_CACHE  # True to ignore cache of spents in transaction, with more than INSIGHT_SAFE_CONFIRMATIONS confirmations. This is useful for tracking double spents for old transactions.\nENABLE_MAILBOX # if \"true\" will enable mailbox plugin\nENABLE_CLEANER # if \"true\" will enable message db cleaner plugin\nENABLE_MONITOR # if \"true\" will enable message db monitor plugin\nENABLE_RATELIMITER # if \"true\" will enable the ratelimiter plugin\nLOGGER_LEVEL # defaults to 'info', can be 'debug','verbose','error', etc.\nENABLE_HTTPS # if \"true\" it will server using SSL/HTTPS\n\n```\n\nMake sure that bitcoind is configured to [accept incoming connections using 'rpcallowip'](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Running_Bitcoin).\n\nIn case the network is changed (testnet to livenet or vice versa) levelDB database needs to be deleted. This can be performed running:\n```util/sync.js -D``` and waiting for *insight* to synchronize again.  Once the database is deleted, the sync.js process can be safely interrupted (CTRL+C) and continued from the synchronization process embedded in main app.\n\n## Synchronization\n\nThe initial synchronization process scans the blockchain from the paired bitcoind server to update addresses and balances. *insight-api* needs exactly one trusted bitcoind node to run. This node must have finished downloading the blockchain before running *insight-api*.\n\nWhile *insight* is synchronizing the website can be accessed (the sync process is embedded in the webserver), but there may be missing data or incorrect balances for addresses. The 'sync' status is shown at the `/api/sync` endpoint.\n\nThe blockchain can be read from bitcoind's raw `.dat` files or RPC interface. \nReading the information from the `.dat` files is much faster so it's the\nrecommended (and default) alternative. `.dat` files are scanned in the default\nlocation for each platform (for example, `~/.bitcoin` on Linux). In case a\nnon-standard location is used, it needs to be defined (see the Configuration section).\nAs of June 2014, using `.dat` files the sync process takes 9 hrs.\nfor livenet and 30 mins. for testnet.\n\nWhile synchronizing the blockchain, *insight-api* listens for new blocks and\ntransactions relayed by the bitcoind node. Those are also stored on *insight-api*'s database.\nIn case *insight-api* is shutdown for a period of time, restarting it will trigger\na partial (historic) synchronization of the blockchain. Depending on the size of\nthat synchronization task, a reverse RPC or forward `.dat` syncing strategy will be used.\n\nIf bitcoind is shutdown, *insight-api* needs to be stopped and restarted\nonce bitcoind is restarted.\n\n### Syncing old blockchain data manually\n\n  Old blockchain data can be manually synced issuing:\n\n    $ util/sync.js\n\n  Check util/sync.js --help for options, particulary -D to erase the current DB.\n\n  *NOTE*: there is no need to run this manually since the historic synchronization\n  is built in into the web application. Running *insight-api* normally will trigger\n  the historic sync automatically.\n\n\n### DB storage requirement\n\nTo store the blockchain and address related information, *insight-api* uses LevelDB.\nTwo DBs are created: txs and blocks. By default these are stored on\n\n  ``~/.insight/``\n\nPlease note that some older versions of Insight-API store that on `<insight's root>/db`.\n\nThis can be changed at config/config.js. As of June 2014, storing the livenet blockchain takes ~35GB of disk space (2GB for the testnet).\n\n## Development\n\nTo run insight locally for development with grunt:\n\n```$ NODE_ENV=development grunt```\n\nTo run the tests\n\n```$ grunt test```\n\n\nContributions and suggestions are welcome at [insight-api github repository](https://github.com/bitpay/insight-api).\n\n## Caching schema\n\nSince v0.2 a new cache schema has been introduced. Only information from transactions with\nINSIGHT_SAFE_CONFIRMATIONS settings will be cached (by default SAFE_CONFIRMATIONS=6). There \nare 3 different caches:\n * Number of confirmations \n * Transaction output spent/unspent status\n * scriptPubKey for unspent transactions\n\nCache data is only populated on request, i.e., only after accessing the required data for\nthe first time, the information is cached, there is not pre-caching procedure.  To ignore \ncache by default, use INSIGHT_IGNORE_CACHE. Also, address related calls support `?noCache=1`\nto ignore the cache in a particular API request.\n\n## API\n\nBy default, insight provides a REST API at `/api`, but this prefix is configurable from the var `apiPrefix` in the `config.js` file.\n\nThe end-points are:\n\n\n### Block\n```\n  /api/block/[:hash]\n  /api/block/00000000a967199a2fad0877433c93df785a8d8ce062e5f9b451cd1397bdbf62\n```\n### Transaction\n```\n  /api/tx/[:txid]\n  /api/tx/525de308971eabd941b139f46c7198b5af9479325c2395db7f2fb5ae8562556c\n```\n### Address\n```\n  /api/addr/[:addr][?noTxList=1&noCache=1]\n  /api/addr/mmvP3mTe53qxHdPqXEvdu8WdC7GfQ2vmx5?noTxList=1\n```\n### Address Properties\n```\n  /api/addr/[:addr]/balance\n  /api/addr/[:addr]/totalReceived\n  /api/addr/[:addr]/totalSent\n  /api/addr/[:addr]/unconfirmedBalance\n```\nThe response contains the value in Satoshis.\n### Unspent Outputs\n```\n  /api/addr/[:addr]/utxo[?noCache=1]\n```\nSample return:\n``` json\n[\n    {\n      address: \"n2PuaAguxZqLddRbTnAoAuwKYgN2w2hZk7\",\n      txid: \"dbfdc2a0d22a8282c4e7be0452d595695f3a39173bed4f48e590877382b112fc\",\n      vout: 0,\n      ts: 1401276201,\n      scriptPubKey: \"76a914e50575162795cd77366fb80d728e3216bd52deac88ac\",\n      amount: 0.001,\n      confirmations: 3\n    },\n    {\n      address: \"n2PuaAguxZqLddRbTnAoAuwKYgN2w2hZk7\",\n      txid: \"e2b82af55d64f12fd0dd075d0922ee7d6a300f58fe60a23cbb5831b31d1d58b4\",\n      vout: 0,\n      ts: 1401226410,\n      scriptPubKey: \"76a914e50575162795cd77366fb80d728e3216bd52deac88ac\",\n      amount: 0.001,\n      confirmation: 6    \n      confirmationsFromCache: true,\n    }\n]\n```\nPlease note that in case confirmations are cached (which happens by default when the number of confirmations is bigger that INSIGHT_SAFE_CONFIRMATIONS) the response will include the pair confirmationsFromCache:true, and confirmations will equal INSIGHT_SAFE_CONFIRMATIONS. See noCache and INSIGHT_IGNORE_CACHE options for details.\n\n\n\n### Unspent Outputs for multiple addresses\nGET method:\n```\n  /api/addrs/[:addrs]/utxo\n  /api/addrs/2NF2baYuJAkCKo5onjUKEPdARQkZ6SYyKd5,2NAre8sX2povnjy4aeiHKeEh97Qhn97tB1f/utxo\n```\n\nPOST method:\n```\n  /api/addrs/utxo\n```\n\nPOST params:\n```\naddrs: 2NF2baYuJAkCKo5onjUKEPdARQkZ6SYyKd5,2NAre8sX2povnjy4aeiHKeEh97Qhn97tB1f\n```\n\n### Transactions by Block\n```\n  /api/txs/?block=HASH\n  /api/txs/?block=00000000fa6cf7367e50ad14eb0ca4737131f256fc4c5841fd3c3f140140e6b6\n```\n### Transactions by Address\n```\n  /api/txs/?address=ADDR\n  /api/txs/?address=mmhmMNfBiZZ37g1tgg2t8DDbNoEdqKVxAL\n```\n### Transaction broadcasting\nPOST method:\n```\n  /api/tx/send\n```\nPOST params:\n```\n  rawtx: \"signed transaction as hex string\"\n\n  eg\n\n  rawtx: 01000000017b1eabe0209b1fe794124575ef807057c77ada2138ae4fa8d6c4de0398a14f3f00000000494830450221008949f0cb400094ad2b5eb399d59d01c14d73d8fe6e96df1a7150deb388ab8935022079656090d7f6bac4c9a94e0aad311a4268e082a725f8aeae0573fb12ff866a5f01ffffffff01f0ca052a010000001976a914cbc20a7664f2f69e5355aa427045bc15e7c6c77288ac00000000\n\n```\nPOST response:\n```\n  {\n      txid: [:txid]\n  }\n\n  eg\n\n  {\n      txid: \"c7736a0a0046d5a8cc61c8c3c2821d4d7517f5de2bc66a966011aaa79965ffba\"\n  }\n```\n\n### Historic blockchain data sync status\n```\n  /api/sync\n```\n\n### Live network p2p data sync status\n```\n  /api/peer\n```\n\n### Status of the bitcoin network\n```\n  /api/status?q=xxx\n```\n\nWhere \"xxx\" can be:\n\n * getInfo\n * getDifficulty\n * getTxOutSetInfo\n * getBestBlockHash\n * getLastBlockHash\n\n## Web Socket API\nThe web socket API is served using [socket.io](http://socket.io).\n\nThe following are the events published by insight:\n\n'tx': new transaction received from network.

Status](https://travis-ci.org/bitpay/bitcore.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bitpay/bitcore)\n[![Coverage Status](https://img.shields.io/coveralls/bitpay/bitcore.svg)](https://coveralls.io/r/bitpay/bitcore)\n\nA pure, powerful core for your bitcoin project.\n\nBitcore is a complete, native interface to the Bitcoin network, and provides the core functionality needed to develop apps for bitcoin.\n\n#Principles\n\nBitcoin is a powerful new peer-to-peer platform for the next generation of financial technology. The decentralized nature of the Bitcoin network allows for highly resilient bitcoin infrastructure, and the developer community needs reliable, open-source tools to implement bitcoin apps and services.\n\n**Bitcore unchains developers from fallible, centralized APIs, and provides the tools to interact with the real Bitcoin network.**\n\n#Get Started\n\nBitcore runs on [node](http://nodejs.org/), and can be installed via [npm](https://npmjs.org/):\n\n```\nnpm install bitcore\n```\n\nIt is a collection of objects useful to bitcoin applications; class-like idioms are enabled via [Soop](https://github.com/bitpay/soop). In most cases, a developer will require the object's class directly. For instance:\n\n```javascript\nvar bitcore = require('bitcore');\nvar Address = bitcore.Address;\nvar Transaction = bitcore.Transaction;\nvar PeerManager = bitcore.PeerManager;\n```\n\n#Examples\n\nExamples are provided [here](examples.md)\nBuild the examples by installing and running gulp:\n\n```\nnpm install -g gulp\ngulp\n```\n\nJavascript files available at [/examples](/examples) folder.\n\n\n#Security\n\nPlease use at your own risk.\n\nBitcore is still under heavy development and not quite ready for \"drop-in\" production use. If you find a security issue, please email security@bitcore.io.\n\n#Contributing\n\nBitcore needs some developer love. Please send pull requests for bug fixes, code optimization, and ideas for improvement.\n\n#Browser support\n\n## Building the browser bundle\n\nTo build bitcore full bundle for the browser (this is automatically executed after you run `npm install`):\n\n```\nnode browser/build.js -a\n```\n\nThis will generate a `browser/bundle.js` file which you can include in your HTML to use bitcore in the browser.\n\n##Example browser usage\n\nFrom example/simple.html\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <body>\n    <script src=\"../browser/bundle.js\"></script>\n    <script>\n      var bitcore = require('bitcore');\n      var Address = bitcore.Address;\n      var a = new Address('1KerhGhLn3SYBEQwby7VyVMWf16fXQUj5d');\n      console.log('1KerhGhLn3SYBEQwby7VyVMWf16fXQUj5d is valid? '+a.isValid());\n    </script>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\nYou can check a more complex usage example at examples/example.html.\n\n## Generating a customized browser bundle\n\nTo build the main bitcore bundle, run:\n\n```\nnode browser/build.js -m\n```\n\nTo build all features into the bitcore bundle (which will lead to a large filesize), run:\n\n```\nnode browser/build.js -a\n```\n\nTo generate a customized bitcore bundle, you can specify which submodules you want to include in it with the -s option:\n\n```\nnode browser/build.js -s lib/Transaction,lib/Address\n```\n\nThis will generate a `browser/bundle.js` containing only the Transaction and Address class, with all their dependencies.  Use this option if you are not using the whole bitcore library, to optimize the bundle size, script loading time, and general resource usage.\n\n## Tests\n\nRun tests in node:\n\n```\nmocha\n```\n\nOr generate tests in the browser:\n\n```\ngrunt shell\n```\n\nAnd then open test/index.html in your browser.\n\nTo run the code coverage report:\n\n```\nnpm run-script coverage\n```\n\nAnd then open coverage/lcov-report/index.html in your browser.\n\n#License\n\n**Code released under [the MIT license](https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore/blob/master/LICENSE).**\n\nCopyright 2013-2014 BitPay, Inc.

However, this is just an implementation detail\nthat shouldn't affect your code.\n\n### Example\n\n#### If you're the payer (sender)\n\n```js\nvar Stealth = require('stealth')\n\n// you get this from the person you're going to pay (receiver)\nvar addr = 'vJmtuUb8ysKiM1HtHQF23FGfjGAKu5sM94UyyjknqhJHNdj5CZzwtpGzeyaATQ2HvuzomNVtiwsTJSWzzCBgCTtUZbRFpzKVq9MAUr'\nvar stealth = Stealth.fromString(addr)\n\n// single-use nonce key pair, works with CoinKey, bitcoinjs-lib, bitcore, etc\nvar keypair = require('coinkey').createRandom()\n\n// generate payment address\nvar payToAddress = stealth.genPaymentAddress(keypair.privateKey)\n\n// create transaction with two outputs:\n// 1. Regular pay-to-pubkeyhash with `payToAddress` as recipient\n// 2. OP_RETURN with `keypair.publicKey`\n```\n\n\n#### If you're the payee (recipient)\n\n```js\nvar Stealth = require('stealth')\n\n// you need to scan every transaction and look for the following:\n// 1. does the transaction contain an OP_RETURN?\n// 2. if yes, then extract the OP_RETURN\n// 3. is the OP_RETURN data a compressed public key (33 bytes)?\n// 4. if yes, check if mine\n\n// generate two key pairs, can use CoinKey, bitcoinjs-lib, bitcore, etc\nvar payloadKeyPair = require('coinkey').createRandom()\nvar scanKeyPair = require('coinkey').createRandom()\n\n// note, the private keys are NOT encoded in the Stealth address\n// you need to save them somewhere\nvar stealth = new Stealth({\n  payloadPrivKey: payloadKeyPair.privateKey,\n  payloadPubKey: payloadKeyPair.publicKey,\n  scanPrivKey: scanKeyPair.privateKey,\n  scanPubKey: scanKeyPair.publicKey\n})\n\nvar addr = stealth.toString()\n// => 'vJmtuUb8ysKiM1HtHQF23FGfjGAKu5sM94UyyjknqhJHNdj5CZzwtpGzeyaATQ2HvuzomNVtiwsTJSWzzCBgCTtUZbRFpzKVq9MAUr'\n\n// publish addr or give it someone\n// unlike regular Bitcoin addresses, you can use\n// stealth address as much as you like\n\n// scan and decode transactions\n\nvar opReturnPubKey = /* */\nvar pubKeyHashWithPayment = /* */\n\nvar keypair = stealth.checkPaymentPubKeyHash(opReturnPubKey, pubKeyHashWithPayment)\n\n// it NOT YOURS, `keypair` will be falsey\n\nif (keypair == null) {\n  console.log('payment is not mine')\n} else {\n  console.log('payment is mine')\n\n  // redeem with `privKey`\n  console.log(keypair.privKey)\n}\n```\n\nAPI\n---\n\n(TODO)\n\n### + fromRandom([config])\n\nClass method to create a stealth key from a random entropy.

Charles](https://github.com/ryanxcharles), specifically the following\nresources:\n\n- https://github.com/ryanxcharles/fullnode\n- https://gist.github.com/ryanxcharles/1c0f95d0892b4a92d70a\n\n\n### Additional Resources\n\n- Dark Wallet description: https://wiki.unsystem.net/en/index.php/DarkWallet/Stealth\n- Dark Wallet infographic: https://wiki.unsystem.net/en/images/e/e5/RHhNKL6.jpg\n- Stealth Whitepaper: http://sourceforge.net/p/bitcoin/mailman/message/31813471/\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nMIT\n","default_branch":"master","commits":36,"devPackages":["coveralls","istanbul","mocha","standard"],"packages":["bs58","ecurve"],"devPackagesDescr":{"coveralls":"takes json-cov output into stdin and POSTs to coveralls.io","istanbul":"Yet another JS code coverage tool that computes statement, line, function and branch coverage with module loader hooks to transparently add coverage when running tests.

library.\n\n## Principles\n\nLitecoin is a powerful new peer-to-peer platform for the next generation of financial technology. The decentralized nature of the Litecoin network allows for highly resilient litecoin infrastructure, and the developer community needs reliable, open-source tools to implement litecoin apps and services.\n\n## Get Started\n\n```\nnpm install litecore-lib\n```\n\n```\nbower install litecore-lib\n```\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe complete docs are hosted here: [litecore documentation](http://litecore.io/guide/). There's also a [litecore API reference](http://litecore.io/api/) available generated from the JSDocs of the project, where you'll find low-level details on each litecore utility.\n\n- [Read the Developer Guide](http://litecore.io/guide/)\n- [Read the API Reference](http://litecore.io/api/)\n\nTo get community assistance and ask for help with implementation questions, please use our [community forums](https://forum.litecore.io/).\n\n## Examples\n\n* [Generate a random address](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecore-lib/blob/master/docs/examples.md#generate-a-random-address)\n* [Generate a address from a SHA256 hash](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecore-lib/blob/master/docs/examples.md#generate-a-address-from-a-sha256-hash)\n* [Import an address via WIF](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecore-lib/blob/master/docs/examples.md#import-an-address-via-wif)\n* [Create a Transaction](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecore-lib/blob/master/docs/examples.md#create-a-transaction)\n* [Sign a Bitcoin message](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecore-lib/blob/master/docs/examples.md#sign-a-bitcoin-message)\n* [Verify a Bitcoin message](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecore-lib/blob/master/docs/examples.md#verify-a-bitcoin-message)\n* [Create an OP RETURN transaction](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecore-lib/blob/master/docs/examples.md#create-an-op-return-transaction)\n* [Create a 2-of-3 multisig P2SH address](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecore-lib/blob/master/docs/examples.md#create-a-2-of-3-multisig-p2sh-address)\n* [Spend from a 2-of-2 multisig P2SH address](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecore-lib/blob/master/docs/examples.md#spend-from-a-2-of-2-multisig-p2sh-address)\n\n\n## Security\n\nWe're using Litecore in production, as are [many others](http://litecore.io#projects), but please use common sense when doing anything related to finances! We take no responsibility for your implementation decisions.\n\nIf you find a security issue, please email security@bitpay.com.\n\n## Contributing\n\nPlease send pull requests for bug fixes, code optimization, and ideas for improvement. For more information on how to contribute, please refer to our [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecore-lib/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) file.\n\n## Building the Browser Bundle\n\nTo build a litecore-lib full bundle for the browser:\n\n```sh\ngulp browser\n```\n\nThis will generate files named `litecore-lib.js` and `litecore-lib.min.js`.\n\nYou can also use our pre-generated files, provided for each release along with a PGP signature by one of the project's maintainers. To get them, checkout a release commit (for example, https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore-lib/commit/e33b6e3ba6a1e5830a079e02d949fce69ea33546 for v0.12.6).\n\nTo verify signatures, use the following PGP keys:\n- @braydonf: https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x9BBF07CAC07A276D `D909 EFE6 70B5 F6CC 89A3 607A 9BBF 07CA C07A 276D`\n- @gabegattis: https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x441430987182732C `F3EA 8E28 29B4 EC93 88CB  B0AA 4414 3098 7182 732C`\n- @kleetus: https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x33195D27EF6BDB7F `F8B0 891C C459 C197 65C2 5043 3319 5D27 EF6B DB7F`\n- @matiu: https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x9EDE6DE4DE531FAC `25CE ED88 A1B1 0CD1 12CD  4121 9EDE 6DE4 DE53 1FAC`\n\n\n## Development & Tests\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecore-lib\ncd litecore-lib\nnpm install\n```\n\nRun all the tests:\n\n```sh\ngulp test\n```\n\nYou can also run just the Node.js tests with `gulp test:node`, just the browser tests with `gulp test:browser`\nor create a test coverage report (you can open `coverage/lcov-report/index.html` to visualize it) with `gulp coverage`.\n\n## License\n\nCode released under [the MIT license](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecore-lib/blob/master/LICENSE).\n\nCopyright 2013-2017 BitPay, Inc.
